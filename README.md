# WSN_OMNeT
Simulation of a wireless network scenario in which stationary nodes exchange messages. 
The network consists of n transmitter nodes and 1 receiver so that each node is in the same range of coverage of the other nodes. The battery power consumption was simulated, since each node in the network is battery powered. This project was developed using OMNeT++ and INET-based libraries.
